# Web Filter Extension

This is my graduation Project for Fall Term. This Chrome extension aimed at enhancing the browsing experience by filtering unwanted content on webpages. 

The extension is designed to filter list structures on webpages according to user input, enabling users to more easily find the information they are looking for. These keywords are saved to extension’s storage, allowing the filter choice to be remembered on different webpages. The extension’s user interface is simple and allows the user to enter keywords to filter, as well as options to clear all filters or remove individual filters. 

One of the unique features of this extension is its ability to recognize custom attributes on webpages where the list structures do not have repeated class names or specific IDs. This is achieved through a “learning mode” where the user can select a list element and save the attributes associated with that element. The extension then uses these attributes to recognize the structure on that domain in the future, making the filtering process more efficient and supporting as many of web pages as possible. 

In addition, the extension uses a dynamic filtering process that continues to filter even when new content is loaded on the page, ensuring that the browsing experience is not interrupted. Overall, this project presents a comprehensive solution to the problem of unwanted content on the internet by providing a user-friendly and efficient filtering tool in the form of a Chrome extension.
